# noginx

A real-time NGINX anomaly detection and alert system.

# Steps to Run noginx
- Make sure you have NGINX installed
- It will automatically capture logs from "/var/log/nginx/access.log", this is where Unix stores its NGINX logs.
- Make sure you are in the root directory ie noginx
- Create a python virtual env using
    ```console 
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
- Download all the dependencies using
    ```console
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Make a .env file, store it at root, it will include these fields:-
    ```json
        PREDICT_ONE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict_one"
        NOGINX_MAIL_ID = "***@gmail.com" (add yours)
        NOGINX_MAIL_PASSWORD = "**** **** **** ****" (Find out the "App password" for your gmail account after enabling 2fa and paste it here)
        RECEIVER_MAIL_ID = "***@gmail.com" (mail will be sent to this ID)
    ```
- Make sure you are in the root directory
- Start the server
- ```console
    cd fastapi_backend
    uvicorn api_server:app --reload
  ```
- On another terminal, Start the watcher
- ```console
    cd watcher
    python3 watcher.py
  ```


# ML Model
- Model is trained on the NGINX logs dataset publicly available at [nginx logs](https://github.com/elastic/examples/blob/master/Common%20Data%20Formats/nginx_logs/README.md)
- Model is trained using Isolation Forest algorithm.
- Model is saved at location noginx/data/model.pkl

# Features extraction and pre-processing
- Raw logs is processed using parse_logs.py and CSV file is stored at location noginx/data/nginx_logs.csv
- Features are extracted from the csv file using process_csv.py
- Mapping of raw features(string) to integer is done and stored in encoder_mappings.json at noginx/data/encoder_mappings.json

# Backend server
- FastAPI is used, and the server can be run via the file api_server.py at noginx/fastapi_backend/api_server.py
- Gives two endpoints
- 1.
     ```console
         /predict
     ```
     This returns the result if anomaly true or not for multiple logs at once.

     Request JSON format:
     ```json
        {
            "features": [{
                "status": 304,
                "size": 0,
                "method": 1,
                "path": 0,
                "user_agent": 54,
                "hour_of_day": 8
                }]
        }
     ```
- 2.
     ```console
         /predict_one
     ```
     This returns the result if anomaly true or not for just one log.

     Request JSON format:
     ```json
        {
            "feature": {
                "status": 304,
                "size": 0,
                "method": 1,
                "path": 0,
                "user_agent": 54,
                "hour_of_day": 8
                }
        }
     ```
    
- Response format
    ```json
            [
                {
                    "anomaly": false
                }
            ]
    ```

## On detecting anomaly
 - It alerts the system by sending it a notification
 - Also send a mail to the user containing all the necessary info of the anomaly.

## Note:-
- For company specific usecases, you will need to train the model on the company specific data.
- For that either contact me at [Abhinav Jha](www.x.com/AbhinavXJ) else if you think you know the stuff then here are the steps
- Store all your NGINX logs at nginx.log at noginx/data/nginx.log
- RUN 
    ```console
        python3 parse_logs.py
    ```
- RUN
    ```console
       python3 process_csv.py
    ```
- To train the model,
- RUN 
    ```console
        python3 train_model.py
    ```
- You can customise the model via the feature engineering or tweaking with the Isolation Forest.
